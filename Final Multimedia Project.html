	<h1>Short Animation</h1>
	<p>The artistic inspiration for this project is about futuristic technology gadgets. I chose to do this kind of project because I know that our future is passing by and there are a lot of brand new technologies that the company has developed. I made this on my own by doing short animation to demonstrate the futuristic of technology. The format I choose to make this animation is doing short animation. This video is about how I used my storyboard and turned it into a short animation.  Nothing has changed from my storyboard to finish. I just followed up my storyboard to turn it into animation.</p>
